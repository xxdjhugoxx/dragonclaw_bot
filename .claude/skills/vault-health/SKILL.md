# Vault Health

Monitoring and improving knowledge graph health. Built on patterns from [arscontexta](https://github.com/agenticnotetaking/arscontexta) — derivation engine for Claude Code.

## Origin

Skill based on arscontexta analysis (Heinrich's derivation engine, 249 research claims).

Key adopted patterns:
- **Health scoring** — composite metric for quantitative vault assessment
- **Explicit wikilinks in MOC** — instead of dataview (invisible to agents)
- **Operational learning loop** — observations → patterns → improvements
- **Typed relationships** — links with context phrases, not bare `related:[]`
- **Description as retrieval filter** — progressive disclosure for agents

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Full diagnostics (health score, orphans, broken links, dead-ends)
uv run vault/.claude/skills/graph-builder/scripts/analyze.py

# Regenerate MOC with explicit wikilinks
uv run vault/.claude/skills/vault-health/scripts/generate_moc.py

# Find who links to a file
bash vault/.claude/skills/vault-health/scripts/backlinks.sh "business/crm/acme-corp"

# Find and fix broken links (dry run)
uv run vault/.claude/skills/vault-health/scripts/fix_links.py

# Apply fixes
uv run vault/.claude/skills/vault-health/scripts/fix_links.py --apply
```

---

## Health Score

Composite metric in analyze.py. Formula:

```
health_score = 100
    - (orphan_ratio × 30)         # orphans = knowledge loss
    - (broken_ratio × 30)         # broken links = fragmentation
    - max(0, (3 - avg_links) × 15)  # target: 3+ links/file
    - ((1 - desc_ratio) × 10)     # description coverage
```

### Metrics and targets

| Metric | Target | How to improve |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Health Score | >80 | All other metrics |
| Avg links/file | >3.0 | generate_moc.py, typed relationships |
| Broken links | <50 | fix_links.py, manual review |
| Orphans | <30 | graph-builder orphan resolution |
| Dead-ends | <100 | Add backlinks to CRM |
| Desc coverage | >50% | Add description to frontmatter |

### Trend tracking

History stored in `.graph/health-history.json` (up to 90 entries). Each analyze.py run adds a data point.

```bash
# View trend
cat vault/.graph/health-history.json | python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
for d in data[-10:]:
    print(f\"{d['date']}: {d['health_score']}/100 | links: {d['total_links']} | broken: {d['broken_links']}\")
"
```

## MOC Generation

`generate_moc.py` creates Maps of Content with **explicit wikilinks and context phrases** (arscontexta pattern). Dataview queries preserved at end of files.

### What it generates

**MOC-business.md:**
- Active Deals (with deadline and deal value)
- High Priority clients
- Grouping by industry (FMCG, Banks, Retail, ...)
- Within industry: Active first, then Prospect

**MOC-projects.md:**
- Hot/Active leads
- Clients
- Projects, Resources

### Wikilink format

```markdown
- [[business/crm/acme-corp\|Acme Corp]] — Active, p1, Project $XXK, deadline YYYY-MM-DD
```

Each link contains: status, priority, deal info, region, deadline — agent sees context without opening file.

### When to run

- After adding new CRM files
- After updating status/deal_status in CRM
- Recommended: weekly or when changes in `business/crm/` / `projects/`

---

## Link Repair

### fix_links.py

Finds broken links and suggests fixes via fuzzy stem matching.

**Strategies:**
1. **Trailing backslash** — Obsidian table escaping artifact (`\|`)
2. **Wrong prefix** — `crm/company` → `business/crm/company`
3. **Stem match** — `old-name` → finds `new-name.md` by stem match

**Exclusions:** backup directories, attachment embeds, directory links.

```bash
# Dry run — shows suggestions
uv run vault/.claude/skills/vault-health/scripts/fix_links.py

# Apply
uv run vault/.claude/skills/vault-health/scripts/fix_links.py --apply
```

### backlinks.sh

Find files linking TO specified file (incoming links).

```bash
# Who links to Acme Corp?
bash vault/.claude/skills/vault-health/scripts/backlinks.sh "business/crm/acme-corp"

# Who links to MEMORY.md?
bash vault/.claude/skills/vault-health/scripts/backlinks.sh "MEMORY"
```

### Dead-end detection

Dead-end = file with outgoing links but no incoming (knows about others, but nobody knows about it). Detected by analyze.py, output in report.md.

---

## Weekly Reflection

Operational learning loop: observations → patterns → proposals.

### Trigger

- Every Sunday
- When observations in `.session/handoff.md` reach ≥10

### Process

1. Read `.session/handoff.md` → collect `## Observations`
2. Read `.graph/health-history.json` → week's trend
3. Group observations by type (friction/pattern/idea)
4. Find recurring patterns (>2 occurrences)
5. Propose concrete improvements (file + change)
6. Write reflection file
7. Clear processed observations from handoff.md

### Output

```
thoughts/reflections/YYYY-WNN-system-reflection.md
```

Detailed template: `.claude/rules/weekly-reflection.md`

### Observation format

In `.session/handoff.md`, section `## Observations`:

```markdown
- [friction] 2026-02-19: mcp-cli timeout 3x — retry saved, -60 sec
- [pattern] 2026-02-19: 65 "broken links" were attachment embeds
- [idea] 2026-02-19: generate_moc.py in process.sh chain
```

Types: `friction` (something broke/slow), `pattern` (recurring), `idea` (improvement).

---

## Typed Relationships

When adding links between files, use context phrases (arscontexta pattern):

| Type | When | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| **extends** | Develops an idea | `[[note]] — extends: deepens analysis` |
| **context** | Background info | `[[note]] — context: meeting where discussed` |
| **supports** | Supports a goal | `[[goal]] — supports: annual target` |
| **contradicts** | Contradicts | `[[note]] — contradicts: different approach` |
| **enables** | Makes possible | `[[tool]] — enables: workflow` |
| **requires** | Dependency | `[[resource]] — requires: API key` |

---

## Description Guidelines

Description = retrieval filter, NOT summary. Adds information BEYOND title.

```yaml
# WRONG (repeats title):
# title: "Acme Corp"
description: "Company Acme Corp"

# RIGHT (adds retrieval info):
# title: "Acme Corp"
description: "Key client in [industry], active deal $XXK, [project] in progress"
```

Target: ~150 chars. Scope, mechanism, implication — not retelling.

---

## Automation in process.sh

analyze.py runs **automatically** every day through `scripts/process.sh`:
- If daily is empty → graph-only rebuild
- After full processing → final rebuild

generate_moc.py, fix_links.py, backlinks.sh — manual run as needed.
