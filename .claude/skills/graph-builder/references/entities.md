## Finding file for entity

```python
def find_file_for_entity(entity: str, vault_path: Path) -> Path | None:
    """Find file for an entity."""

    # Normalize: Client-A -> client-a
    slug = entity.lower().replace(" ", "-")

    # Search in CRM
    crm_path = vault_path / "business" / "crm" / f"{slug}.md"
    if crm_path.exists():
        return crm_path

    # Search in Projects
    for subdir in ["clients", "leads"]:
        path = vault_path / "projects" / subdir / f"{slug}.md"
        if path.exists():
            return path

    # Fuzzy search by filename
    for f in vault_path.rglob("*.md"):
        if slug in f.stem.lower():
            return f

    return None
```

## Link normalization

def normalize_link(link: str) -> str:

    # Remove alias: [[file|alias]] -> file
    link = link.split("|")[0]

    # Add .md if missing
    if not link.endswith(".md"):
        link = link + ".md"

    return link
```
